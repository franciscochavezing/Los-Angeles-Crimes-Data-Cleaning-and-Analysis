# Los Angeles Crimes Data Cleaning and Analysis
The project focused on cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, performing exploratory data analysis, and addressing specific questions regarding crime trends and patterns. We systematically managed missing data, outliers, and standardized or normalized data as necessary. Additionally, we employed ARIMA, a time series forecasting method, to enhance our understanding and prediction of crime trends. Visualizations were then generated to communicate the derived insights from the dataset effectively.
